# Modifiers
The smart contract explained previously is a good starting point. However, it has some flaws. For instance, it is possible to execute scoring functions (`scoreFreeThrow`, `scoreFieldGoal` and `scoreThreePointer`) after game is finished. And that is not possible in a real game. In order to fix that behaviour we could use an `if` statement at the beginning of each function, and it would work. But it requires writing the same `if` statement three times. In cases like this is better to use a `modifier`.

Modifiers are properties of contracts that can be used to change the behaviour of functions in a declarative way. In other words, modifers allow to automatically check a condition prior to executing the function. The `modifier` for our example above would be as follows:

```js
modifier gameInProgress {
  require(!gameFinished, "Game is finished. No more points!");
  _;
}
```

* Modifiers make use of `require` function, which arguments are a condition and a message in case condition is not met.
* Last line is `_;`

Now we can add the `modifier` on previous example and use it. It is mandatory to include the modifier name in the header of the desired functions.
