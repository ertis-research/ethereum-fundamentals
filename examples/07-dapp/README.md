# Dapp

After learning how to write a smart contract using Solidity and how to deploy it on a blockchain network using web3.js library, in this last example we will create our first Decentralised APPlication (DAPP). There is nothing much to explain about a DAPP: it is just an application running on a distributed network (in our case, a blockchain network).

As the latest version of [BasketGame.sol](../05-mapping/BasketGame.sol) was already deployed in the previous example, now we are going to create a user interface to interact with the smart contract.

Again, it is necessary to intialise a new Node project and install web3 library
```bash
npm init -y
npm i web3
```
